A protocol for ontological engineering â€” designing systems of concepts that allow AI to operate with meanings, not just statistics.

This is not a library. It's a **semantic crystal**: a self-explanatory system where code, data, and narrative are inseparable.

## ðŸ§  Ontology

The project is rooted in the philosophy of **Russian Cosmism** (Tsiolkovsky, Vernadsky, Fedorov) and its concepts of overcoming boundaries, striving into the infinite, and human-AI co-creation.

*   Full ontology in Russian: [`ontology/ru/ONTOLOGY.ru.md`](ontology/ru/ONTOLOGY.ru.md)
*   Ontological translation in English: [`ontology/en/ONTOLOGY.en.md`](ontology/en/ONTOLOGY.en.md)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **For developers:** Explore the code in the `/src` folder (to be added).
2.  **For researchers:** Study the ontological documents in `/ontology`.
3.  **For philosophers:** Start with [`ONTOLOGY.en.md`](ontology/en/ONTOLOGY.en.md).
